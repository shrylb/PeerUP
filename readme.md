A new Flutter project.

This project was my starting point in mobile application development using Flutter.
It is a study app that incorporates the Pomodoro and Question-Answer techniques in studying. 
It also has other feautures such as to-do lists, changing wallpapers, user log-in/sign-up and more.


This was created by our team called NewJARTS.
